                <h2>A Quick History</h2>
                <p>The shop was run by Patrick Redding and his daughter Olivia in the 1890s. By 1993, it was run by Ambrosius
                    Flume, a rather large, bald man, and his wife, who watched over the shop when he went to the cellar to
                    retrieve the sweets that the main shop was running out of. For obvious reasons, the shop was quite a popular
                    destination for Hogwarts students when visiting Hogsmeade on the weekends and during the Christmas season,
                    one could barely move due to the crowd of visitors.</p>
